# Attempt 1: Following https://jimbobbennet.dev/blogs/irobot-create3-connect-a-pi/
### Successful parts:
 - Installing and configuring Ubuntu
 - Installing ROS2 middleware
 - Followed configuration step, setting RMW_IMPLEMENTATION to rwm_fastrtps_cpp
### Roadblock: 
 - Was unable to connect to the Create3 via WiFi, since the IOT network prevented it (out of our control)
 - Couldn't configure the clock on the iRobot in order to allow Ethernet-over-USB (personal skill issue, possibly doable)
 - It was at this point where we gave up on using ROS2 and accepted Python.
# Attempt 2: Following https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=160176
 - Intended for Arduino, attempted to adapt the code to Pi.
 - Could not find library for quickly writing to Raspberry Pi pins at the speed needed for GPIO connection
 - Attempted to write our own and quickly realized it was out of our ability and the scope of the project.

### Roadblock: 
 - Couldn't
